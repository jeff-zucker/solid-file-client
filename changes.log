  * separated test folder into test-folder/solid-api and test-folder/easy
    to make sure they don't interfere with each other
    test-folder automatically gets cleared before each test run (see setup.js)
  * folderUtils now imports rdflib instead of passing it around
  * all "advanced" API methods except for fetch now throw if !response.ok
    to match this behavior, createFolder now rejects if parent doesn't exists
    (this will probably be discussed and changed in the future)
  * fixed deleteFolderContents and added one test for it

OA 2019-06-08 01:00 PDT
  * changed `prepublish` to `prepublishOnly`
    so it doesn't trigger on npm install
  * added `test:watch` script
  * added `build:dev` script
  * removed `watch` script
  * removed eslint and other unused dev-dependencies
