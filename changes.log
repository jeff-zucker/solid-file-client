  * inital commit of SolidAPI

AB 2019-06-06
  * use webpack externals

JZ 2019-06-07 10:44 PDT
  * ran npm audit fix --force to get rid of downstream vulnerabilities
  * temporarily removed npm run test so things can install

JZ 2019-06-07 13:30 PDT
  * modified this file to track our changes
  * revised error handling as described on github $43
  * added readFile() and test for it

JZ 2019-06-07 18:30 PDT
  * revised errors again
  * hooked up $rdf (it was hard to get it into folderUtils)
  * modified SolidApi.readFolder
  * created many tests
  * added testing back into the build process
  
OA 2019-06-08 03:00 PDT
  * separated test folder into test-folder/solid-api and test-folder/easy
    to make sure they don't interfere with each other
    test-folder automatically gets cleared before each test run (see setup.js)
  * folderUtils now imports rdflib instead of passing it around
  * all "advanced" API methods except for fetch now throw if !response.ok
    to match this behavior, createFolder now rejects if parent doesn't exists
    (this will probably be discussed and changed in the future)
  * fixed deleteFolderContents and added one test for it

OA 2019-06-08 01:00 PDT
  * changed `prepublish` to `prepublishOnly`
    so it doesn't trigger on npm install
  * added `test:watch` script
  * added `build:dev` script
  * removed `watch` script
  * removed eslint and other unused dev-dependencies

JZ 2019-06-08 16:30 PDT
  * more tests
  * modified test imports (diffs between require & import made $rdf hard to see)

JZ 2019-06-08 18:30 PDT
  * refactored readFile to use fetch rather than get
  * modified testApi to catch error status
  * all tests pass now

JZ 2019-06-09 17:00 PDT
  * made crud test work in both catch and response interfaces

JZ 2019-06-09 19:00 PDT
  * slight modification to SolidApi.readFolder to handle parse failures

JZ 2019-06-09 22:00 PDT
  * added getLinks() temporarily in SolidFileClient.js
  * this does a head request using rdflib
    then uses rdflib to parse the Link header
    returns a hash containing the aboslute address of the .acl and .meta links
  * the addresses can then be used to delete,copy,etc. the .acl and .meta files
    using normal methods

JZ 2019-06-10 various commits
  * changed flag for interface from responseInterface to throwsError
  * set the default interface to be throwsError=false
  * created high-level-tasks.md to track progress
  * more shims and tests (see the high-level-tasks.md for details)  

OA 2019-06-11 03:00 PDT
  * to be consistent fetch now throws if response.ok is set to false
    I've updated methods in SolidFileClient to use get and handle thrown errors
  * added some tests for SolidApi
  * added tests for apiUtils 

JZ 2019-06-12 10:00 PDT
  * removed the BeforeAll calls from crud.test.js

JZ 2019-06-12 30:00 PDT
  * added shims and tests for getHead and getLinks
  * made throwErrors and default interface tests run in tandem
